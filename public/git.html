Git can be configured in 3 levels. System > Global (User) < Project
    We can use:
        Git config - - system
        Git config - - global
        Git config 
    To configure Git in respective levels

          Git config - - global  user.name “Lorem Ipsum"
          Git config - - global user.email “lorem@ipsum.com"

    cd ~: takes you to the user directory
    cat .gitconfig: opens the config file
    
Git config - - global core.editor  “emacs” : edit config file with emacs
Git config - - global color.ui true : colourful ui

ls -la .git : opens the .git directory (invisible)
        cat .git/config: opens the config file inside the .git configuration
        cat .git/HEAD: opens the HEAD file which shows where the HEAD is stored (refs/heads/master)
        cat .git/refs/heads/master : Shows the SHA-1 value of the head  
        

GIT ADD/REMOVE/COMMIT

git add . : Adds all changes in that directory to the stage
git add Kano.html : Adds all changes in the Kano.html file to the stage (you can add a space and add more file names to add multiple files to the stage.)
git add Koyukan* : Adds all files and directories that start with "Kano"

git commit -m "Message" : Commits everything that is on the stage.
git commit : Commits without message, text editor opens for the message.
    Between the Repository and the working directory (the one you modify) you have the staging index
    When you use the command "add" you add the changes to the staging area. Then you can selectively
    commit those changes to the repository
git commit -am "Message" : Adds without the staging.
    Warning: When you add without staging, you add ALL changes in the tracked files without staging.
                    Does not include untracked files!!!!
git commit -a : Adds without staging with multiline messages. Your text editor opens and you need to type the message there.

git rm Kano.html : Removes the file, and automatically adds the removed file change to the staged area, you can just commit the change without adding
    Alternatively you can remove the file manually and then use the above command to stage the change.

git mv Kano.html Kanosh.html : Renames the file (mv is move). And stages it for you
    Alternatively you can rename it by UI, then Git sees it as a deleting of the old file and creating a new one.
        In that case you need to stage those two perceived files by rm the old file and add the new file (they are the same file) then commit
Note: Renaming and moving are synonymous, you could move the file in a different directory by simply using the mv command
        It would treat it as a renaming.


GIT CHECK STATUS/DIFFERENCES

git status: shows the current status of the git repository
git diff : shows all the changes made to the file in the working directory against the staging directory. 
git diff --staged : shows all the changes made in the staged area vs. the repository   
    @@ -69,7 Something was removed on line 69, showing 7 lines before and after 
    a -The repository
    b- the working tree
        --  removed
        ++ added
git diff --color-words : Colors the words that were changed

PAGINATOR   (Used fro browsing gitt diffs)
Space bar : Changes the page
B : Backwards
F : Forwards
Q : Quit
-S : Chopping/Wrapping lines


GIT LOGS

git log: shows all the commits that you have made so far
    git log -n 5: Shows the last 5 commit
    git log --since=2010-01-01 : Shows all the commits since the date
    git log --until=2010-02-02 : Shows all the commits until the date
    git log --author="Kaan" : Shows all the commits from the author
    git log --grep="Lux" : Fetches all the commits that has "Lux" in the commit message section
    git log --oneline : Gives a one line commit messages.


VIEW COMMITS
git show dfs35desf (SHA value) : shows the commit made with the SHA value.
git show dfs35desf --color-words : Shows the commit made with changes highligted

COMPARE COMMITS
git diff dfs35desf..4353fdw45 : compares the two commits
git diff dfs35desf..4353fdw45 -- color_words : compares the two commits with highlighted differences
git diff dfs35desf..HEAD : compares the commit against the HEAD



REVERT CHANGES

git checkout -- Kano.html  : Brings back the original Kano.html from the repository and reverts the changes (Make your working directory match the repository
git checkout --. : Brings back all the changed files into their original form (form from the repository)
git checkout 3w4edw3 -- Kano.html : Brings back the Kano.html from that commit.
git reset HEAD Kano.html :Unstage the file



MAKING CHANGES TO THE COMMITS
Not very possible to make changes to the previous commits but you can make changes to the most current one
git commit --amend -m "Make some more changes" : Takes the stuff from the staging area and adds to most recent commit. SHA value changes most obviously.
git revert 3242ertew3: reverts commit to a given SHA

REMOVE UNTRACKED FILES
git clean -f : Deletes all the untracked files, irreversibly
